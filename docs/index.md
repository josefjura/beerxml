# BeerXML Recipe Standard

## Purpose
BeerXML is a free, fully defined XML data description designed for the exchange of beer brewing recipes and other brewing data. Tables of recipes as well as other records such as hops can be represented using BeerXML for use by brewing programs. It is our hope that BeerXML allows the open exchange of recipes between different brewing software packages.
